# ETL project

Hi I am Chinmoy Das. This is the project related to ETL-Extract,Transform and Load. It has given me two parts. For the first part I have read the file and transform into capitals letters the whole txt file. And wrote the final product in the another directory in an txt file.
For the secondd part, Ihave the read an file and asked the client what word occurences needed to be counted. According to the user, in another directory the output of the file or counting of the occurenecs is shown in the txt file.
Thank you
